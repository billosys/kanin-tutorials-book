# Chapter 1 - Hello, World!

In this first tutorial, we're going to build the messaging world's equivalent of "Hello, World!". Our "Hello world" won't be too complex â€’ we will send a message, receive it,
and then print it on the screen. To do so we need two programs:

1. one that sends a message, and
1. one that receives and prints it.

The producer sends messages to the "hello" queue. The consumer receives
messages from that queue.
