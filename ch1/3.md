## Putting It All Together

You should already have the "sending" code loaded up in a termainal window.
Open another one (be sure you are in the previously-created ``kanin-tutorials``
directory), and Start up the REPL:

```bash
$ make repl-no-deps
Starting an LFE REPL ...
Erlang/OTP 17 [erts-6.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] ...

LFE Shell V6.2 (abort with ^G)
```

This will be your "receiving" terminal. Go ahead and start up the "receive"
loop:

```lisp
> (kt-receiving:receive)
[*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C
```

Switch back over to your "sending" terminal, and fire off four calls of the
``send`` function:

```lisp
> (kt-sending:send)
[x] Sent message '"Hello, world!"'
ok
> (kt-sending:send)
[x] Sent message '"Hello, world!"'
ok
> (kt-sending:send)
[x] Sent message '"Hello, world!"'
ok
> (kt-sending:send)
[x] Sent message '"Hello, world!"'
ok
>
```

Switch back over to your "receiving" terminal, and you should see four messages
indicating proper receipt:

```erlang
[x] Received: <<"Hello, world!">>
[x] Received: <<"Hello, world!">>
[x] Received: <<"Hello, world!">>
[x] Received: <<"Hello, world!">>
```
