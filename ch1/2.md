## Receiving

Our receiver gets messages pushed to it from RabbitMQ, so unlike the sender
which publishes a single message and then closes down, we'll keep the receiver
running to listen for in-coming messages and print them out.

As before, we will need to connect to RabbitMQ server, and the code for that is
the same as in the "send" section above. We will also define a queue and send
the ``queue.declare`` message, to ensure that is exists (this way, regardless
of whether the sender or the receiver starts first, the queue will exist for
either).

You can see the list of queues that exist on your host by issueing the
following command (as the same user who started up RabbitMQ):

```bash
$ /opt/rabbitmq/3.3.5/sbin/rabbitmqctl list_queues
```

This should give you output like the following:

```
Listing queues ...
hello	0
...done.
```

The next thing we'll need to do is set up the ``receive`` function process as
a subscriber, consuming messages from the queue we defined. This is done by
calling ``(kanin-chan:subscribe ...)``. To ensure that the subscription
succeeded, we'll listen for a ``basic.consume_ok`` response, and then set up
our message-receiving loop by calling ``(loop channel)``.

Our ``loop`` function will listen for data that matches a tuple of two records:
a ``basic.deliver`` record and an ``amqp_msg`` record. Whenever a message
matches, we'll display output to the terminal, and then start the loop
listening again.

The complete code for the module that encapsulates this logic is below:

```lisp
(defmodule kt-receiving
  (export all))

(include-lib "kanin/include/amqp-client.lfe")

(defun receive ()
  (let* ((net-opts (make-amqp_params_network host "localhost"))
         ;; create the connection and channel we'll use for sending
         (`#(ok ,connection) (kanin-conn:start net-opts))
         (`#(ok ,channel) (kanin-conn:open-channel connection))
         ;; declare the names we will use
         (queue-name "hello")
         ;; define the data we will send
         (payload "Hello, world!")
         ;; then create the needed records
         (queue (make-queue.declare
                  queue (list_to_binary queue-name)))
         (consumer (make-basic.consume
                     queue (list_to_binary queue-name)
                     no_ack 'true))
         (subscriber (self)))
    ;; set up the queue
    (kanin-chan:call channel queue)
    (io:format "[*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C~n")
    ;; subscribe the receive funtion to the queue
    (kanin-chan:subscribe channel consumer subscriber)
    ;; verify that the 'receive' function gets a successful result from
    ;; the previous (kanin-chan:subscribe ...) call
    (receive
      ((match-basic.consume_ok)
        'ok))
    ;; start listening for messages
    (loop channel)))

(defun loop (channel)
  ;; listen for a message that is a 2-tuple of two records: a basic.deliver
  ;; one, and an amqp_msg one
  (receive
    ((tuple (match-basic.deliver) (match-amqp_msg payload body))
      (io:format "[x] Received: ~p~n" `(,body))
      ;; restart the loop to listen for the next message
      (loop channel))))
```
