## Fair Dispatch

You might have noticed that the dispatching still doesn't work exactly as we
want. For example in a situation with two workers, when all odd messages are
heavy and even messages are light, one worker will be constantly busy and the
other one will do hardly any work. Well, RabbitMQ doesn't know anything about
that and will still dispatch messages evenly.

This happens because RabbitMQ just dispatches a message when the message enters
the queue. It doesn't look at the number of unacknowledged messages for a
consumer. It just blindly dispatches every n-th message to the n-th consumer.

In order to defeat that we can use the ``basic.qos`` method with the
prefetch_count=1 setting. This tells RabbitMQ not to give more than one message
to a worker at a time. Or, in other words, don't dispatch a new message to a
worker until it has processed and acknowledged the previous one. Instead, it
will dispatch it to the next worker that is not still busy:

```lisp
(qos (make-basic.qos prefetch_count 1))
```

### Note about Queue Size

If all the workers are busy, your queue can fill up. You will want to keep an
eye on that, and maybe add more workers, or have some other strategy.
