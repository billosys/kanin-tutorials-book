## Preparation

In the first tutorial we sent a message containing the string "Hello World!".
Now we'll be sending strings that stand for complex tasks. We don't have a real-
world task, like images to be resized or pdf files to be rendered, so let's fake
it by just pretending we're busy - by adding a timeout section to the
``(receive ...)`` part of our ``(loop ...)`` function. We'll take the number of
dots in the string as its complexity; every dot will account for one second of
"work". For example, a fake task described by ``Hello...`` will take three
seconds.

We will slightly modify the ``kt-sending.lfe`` code from our previous example,
to allow arbitrary messages to be sent from the command line. This program will
schedule tasks to our work queue, so let's name it ``kt-new-task.lfe``. Also,
note that we'll use the ``kanin-uri`` module to parse a connection string
this time, instead of creating a record directly.

```lisp
(defmodule kt-new-task
  (export all))

(include-lib "kanin/include/amqp-client.lfe")

(defun send ()
  (send '()))

(defun send (data)
  (let* ((net-opts (kanin-uri:parse "amqp://localhost"))
         (`#(ok ,connection) (kanin-conn:start net-opts))
         (`#(ok ,channel) (kanin-conn:open-channel connection))
         (queue-name "task-queue")
         (routing-key "task-queue")
         (exchange-name "")
         (payload (make-message data))
         (queue (make-queue.declare
                  queue (list_to_binary queue-name)
                  durable 'true))
         (method (make-basic.publish
                   exchange (list_to_binary exchange-name)
                   routing_key (list_to_binary routing-key)))
         (message (make-amqp_msg
                    props (make-P_basic delivery_mode 2)
                    payload (list_to_binary payload))))
    (kanin-chan:call channel queue)
    (kanin-chan:cast channel method message)
    (io:format "[x] Sent message '~p'~n" `(,payload))
    (kanin-chan:close channel)
    (kanin-conn:close connection)))

(defun make-message
  (('())
    "Hello, world!")
  ((data)
    data))
```

Our old ``kt-receiving.lfe`` module also requires some changes: it needs to
fake a second of work for every dot in the message body. It will pop messages
from the queue and perform the task, so let's call it ``kt-worker.lfe``:

```cl
(defmodule kt-worker
  (export all))

(include-lib "kanin/include/amqp-client.lfe")

(defun receive ()
  (let* ((net-opts (kanin-uri:parse "amqp://localhost"))
         (`#(ok ,connection) (kanin-conn:start net-opts))
         (`#(ok ,channel) (kanin-conn:open-channel connection))
         (queue-name "task-queue")
         (queue (make-queue.declare
                  queue (list_to_binary queue-name)
                  durable 'true))
         (qos (make-basic.qos prefetch_count 1))
         (consumer (make-basic.consume
                     queue (list_to_binary queue-name)))
         (subscriber (self)))
    (kanin-chan:call channel queue)
    (io:format "[*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C~n")
    (kanin-chan:call channel qos)
    (kanin-chan:subscribe channel consumer subscriber)
    (receive
      ((match-basic.consume_ok)
        'ok))
    (loop channel)))

(defun loop (channel)
  (receive
    ((tuple (match-basic.deliver delivery_tag tag)
            (match-amqp_msg payload body))
      (io:format "[x] Received: ~p~n" `(,body))
      (do-work body)
      (io:format "[x] Done.~n")
      (kanin-chan:cast channel (make-basic.ack delivery_tag tag))
      (loop channel))))

(defun get-dot-count (data)
  (length
    (list-comp
      ((<- char (binary_to_list data)) (== char #\.))
      char)))

(defun do-work (body)
  (let ((dots (get-dot-count body)))
        (receive
          (after (* dots 1000)
            'ok))))
```
